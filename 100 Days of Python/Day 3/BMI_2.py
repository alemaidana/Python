Instructions
Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Above 35 they are clinically obese.
